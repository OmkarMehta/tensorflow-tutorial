# TensorFlow Tutorial ## &amp;copy;  [Omkar Mehta](omehta2@illinois.edu) ## ### Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, The Grainger College of Engineering,  UIUC ###  &lt;hr style="border:2px solid blue"> &lt;/hr> Until now, I've always used numpy to build neural networks. Now I will step through a deep learning framework that will allow myself to build neural networks more easily. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up machine learning development significantly. All of these frameworks also have a lot of documentation, which I feel that it's fun to read. I will learn to do the following in TensorFlow:   - Initialize variables - Start my own session - Train algorithms  - Implement a Neural Network  Programing frameworks can not only shorten my coding time, but sometimes also perform optimizations that speed up my code.
